## Projects
- [ ] Archive v2

The Archive is something I tried on suggestion of another user, in that script the terminal would, per request and password secured, pull up stories entered in the code. I am currently working on it (as of 04/05/2022), and am currently busy with bug fixes. I am greatful for any help I can get with these! For more information, read the README.md under the archive folder.

- [ ] Project to understand 'for' loop
- [ ] & more

## Information
This is, as you might have already guessed, and open-source project. Since my code isn't special, and rather on a nooby level, I do not mind anyone using it and doing their own stuff with it (unless you have malicious intent)
