# Hello there!

This is archive.py, a small archive script I made. This is a remake of an old database script that I did (and failed to make it work). Sadly, this one also doesn't work, but I wish to work on these issues. Things to do:

## ToDo
- [x] Create stories
- [x] welcome() "options" 
- [x] welcome() "open"
- [x] time.sleep()
- [ ] welcome() "enterpassword"
- [ ] welcome() "open" checking if level is unlocked


## Bug Fixes
- [x] fix entry_1 formatting
- [ ] fix line 434 error "in <module> welcome()"
- [ ] fix line 426 error "in welcome Level0 - {level0_unlock}

## Feedback

For ideas, please keep in mind that I am a beginner. Try to explain why I should do that (to allow me to understand why to make that change, so I can learn while fixing my mistakes)
